# OrbisTOC
Standalone program to create the OrbisTOC.bin files for ME3 and Mass Effect Legendary Edition.

Run from the command line, pass it the game executable, and it will generate a TOC for the base game and all DLCs.

eg. ```.\OrbisTOC.exe "D:\PKGs\Mass Effect Legendary Edition\ME3\LTCG-BioGame.elf"```

You can also drag a game elf file directly onto AutoTOC in Windows Explorer to TOC.
